        <h2>Early Life and Rise</h2>
        <p>Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, Lionel Messi showed a passion for football from a very young age, playing constantly with his older brothers and cousins. Despite his exceptional skill, he faced a significant challenge early in life—a growth hormone deficiency that threatened to derail his dreams. His local club, Newell’s Old Boys, admired his talent but could not afford the costly treatment. At age 13, Messi moved with his family to Spain after FC Barcelona offered to cover his medical expenses and enroll him in their famed La Masia youth academy. Adapting to a new country and culture wasn’t easy, but Messi's dedication and extraordinary ability soon set him apart. He quickly rose through the ranks and made his first-team debut in 2004 at just 17 years old, becoming the youngest player to score a league goal for the club at the time. This marked the beginning of what would become one of the most illustrious careers in football history.</p>
